    <h1>Now your in a subpage</h1>
		
        <p>Here things get 1 step trickier. To locate a file thats outside of the folder we are currently in we use two periods and a forward slash like so <code>"../"</code> <br>For instance
       
       <a href="../index.html"> Go to a page 1 folder up</a>
       <br>
       <br>
       Taking this concept one step further. below we go up a level into our root directory and then down two levels to find an image.
        <img src="../assets/img/pink.gif" />
        <br>
       <br>
        The link to the stylesheet in the head of this document is another example of the same concept.

       Take aways
       
       <h3><code>"../"</code> = UP A FOLDER</h3>
       and
       <h3><code>"folderName/"</code> = DOWN A FOLDER</h3>
        
      </p>
