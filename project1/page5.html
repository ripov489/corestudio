        Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physical handicaps with marvelous delicacy. Last of all he removed her mask. <br>
        <br>She was blindingly beautiful. <br>
         <br>"Now-" said Harrison, taking her hand, "shall we show the people the meaning of the word dance? Music!" he commanded. <br>
         <br>The musicians scrambled back into their chairs, and Harrison stripped them of their handicaps, too. "Play your best," he told them, "and I'll make you barons and dukes and earls." <br>
         <br>The music began. It was normal at first-cheap, silly, false. But Harrison snatched two musicians from their chairs, waved them like batons as he sang the music as he wanted it played. He slammed them back into their chairs. <br>
         <br>The music began again and was much improved. <br>
         <br>Harrison and his Empress merely listened to the music for a while-listened gravely, as though synchronizing their heartbeats with it. <br>
         <br>They shifted their weights to their toes. <br>
         <br>Harrison placed his big hands on the girls tiny waist, letting her sense the weightlessness that would soon be hers. <br>
         <br>And then, in an explosion of joy and grace, into the air they sprang! <br>
         <br>Not only were the laws of the land abandoned, but the law of gravity and the laws of motion as well. <br>
         <br>They reeled, whirled, swiveled, flounced, capered, gamboled, and spun. <br>
         <br>They leaped like deer on the moon. <br>
         <br>The studio ceiling was thirty feet high, but each leap brought the dancers nearer to it. <br>
         <br>It became their obvious intention to kiss the ceiling. They kissed it. <br>
         <br>And then, neutraling gravity with love and pure will, they remained suspended in air inches below the ceiling, and they kissed each other for a long, long time.
         <br>It was then that Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, came into the studio with a double-barreled ten-gauge shotgun. She fired twice, and the Emperor and the Empress were dead before they hit the floor.  <br>
        <br> Diana Moon Glampers loaded the gun again. She aimed it at the musicians and told them they had ten seconds to get their handicaps back on. <br>
         <br>It was then that the Bergerons' television tube burned out. <br>
         <br>Hazel turned to comment about the blackout to George. But George had gone out into the kitchen for a can of beer. <br>
